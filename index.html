    <strong>Heaven Official's Blessing</strong><br>
    "Heaven Official's Blessing" is a captivating series with both a novel and an anime adaptation. The series comprises eight novels in total. The story follows Xie Lian, who was born as the crown prince of a prosperous kingdom and was renowned for his beauty, strength, and purity. Through years of dedicated study and noble deeds, he ascends to godhood. However, his rise is followed by a fall as he is cast from the heavens and banished to the world below. Eight hundred years later, Xie Lian ascends to godhood for the third time, but his actions anger most of the gods. To repay his debts, he is sent to the Mortal Realm to hunt down violent ghosts and troublemaking spirits that prey on the living. Along his journey, he encounters the fascinating and enigmatic San Lang, a young man with whom he feels an instant connection. However, San Lang is more than he appears, and behind his carefree smile lie mysterious secrets. The series beautifully weaves together elements of fantasy, romance, and mystery, making it a compelling read/watch for fans of these genres.
