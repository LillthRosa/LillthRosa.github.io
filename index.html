Hello everyone! My name is Cheng Yu and I'm excited to welcome you to my first blog. Being a high school freshman, I have a great interest in books and anime, and I am eager to share some of my favorites with you. In this blog, I will provide you with detailed reviews and recommendations of the books and anime that I love the most, so you can discover some incredible new titles. Besides that, I will also be sharing some of my daily life experiences through pictures and stories. This will help you to learn more about my hobbies, interests, and daily routines. I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my blog, as this will help me grow and improve, while also giving me a possibility to learn more about your interests. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy creating it.
